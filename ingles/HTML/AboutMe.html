    <p>Hi! My name is Luiz Henrique. I was born in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, but I currently live in São Gonçalo dos Campos.

    I consider myself a Front-End development enthusiast with a passion for creating incredible interfaces and exceptional user experiences. Ever since I entered the world of programming, I've been fascinated by the ability to transform creative ideas into digital reality. What motivates me is the opportunity to make the Front-End part of software/web beautiful, accessible, and functional for everyone.</p>
    
    <p>My passion shines through in every project I engage in. I love working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React Native (my skills) to create responsive designs that work seamlessly on all devices. Additionally, I'm constantly learning and staying updated with Front-End trends to deliver my best.</p>
    
    <p>My goal is to keep growing as a Front-End developer, exploring new technologies, and contributing to challenging projects that enhance the user experience. I'm always open to new learning and collaboration opportunities. I'm excited about what the future holds in this Front-End development journey and eager to be part of projects that make a difference in the field.</p>
