    <h2>My story with coding</h2>

        <div class="paragrafo">
            <span class="paragrafo">My journey into the world of programming commenced at a remarkably young age, when I was just 3 years old in the vibrant city of Salvador. Even then, my limited speaking abilities couldn't stifle my profound curiosity for all things related to computers. My eagerness for computer knowledge led to a deep-seated desire to enroll in a computer course at Microlins. Fast forward to my 8th year, my family's move to São Gonçalo dos Campos, primarily driven by health considerations, marked a pivotal moment. This transition, however, did nothing to diminish my passion for technology and computing. Instead, it ignited a growing flame within me, a fascination that only intensified with time.</span><br>

            <span class="paragrafo">Fast forward to the present, where the global pandemic has left its indelible mark on the world. It was during this period that I stumbled upon the GrassHopper app, a gateway into the fascinating world of programming. With palpable excitement, I embarked on this learning journey. But, as fate would have it, my early enthusiasm soon gave way to frustration due to my struggles with the complex concepts. In this moment of self-doubt, BYJU'S Future School emerged on my horizon. It was marked by persistent ads and tempting promises, signifying a fresh and exhilarating chapter in my quest for knowledge (worth noting that this occurred at the tail end of 2021).</span><br>
            <span class="paragrafo">My intense desire to immerse myself in the world of programming, although fervent, initially remained a well-kept secret. Yet, the passion within me continued to burn. The alluring commercials by BYJU'S played a significant role in its growth. Eventually, I mustered the courage to confide in my father, and together, we embarked on a thrilling journey to explore the possibility of enrolling in BYJU'S. An enlightening trial class confirmed my fascination, and my resolve was further bolstered. I was entirely captivated, and my parents, equally enthused, lent their wholehearted support to my decision. From that point onward, I've been a part of BYJU'S, eagerly and resolutely embracing the boundless realm of programming!</span><br>
            <span class="paragrafo">I extend a cordial invitation to you to explore my achievements and projects in the "Projects" section. My passion for programming knows no bounds, and it continues to evolve with each passing day. I eagerly anticipate what the future holds in this dynamic journey of learning. Every new day presents an exhilarating opportunity to acquire fresh knowledge and broaden my comprehension within the captivating realm of programming.</span><br>
