                     My journey into programming began with an early desire to learn, even at the age of 3, in Salvador. Even though I could hardly speak, I longed for a computer course at Microlins. At the age of 8, we moved to São Gonçalo dos Campos for health reasons, but my passion for computers remained latent. <br>

               <span class="paragrafo"> 
                      Now, fast forward to the pandemic scenario, I stumbled upon the GrassHopper app, which promised to teach programming. Excited, I started learning, but soon realized I wasn't understanding anything. Then, BYJU'S Future School came on my radar through relentless advertisements. That was the turning point (note: it was the end of 2021). <br>

               <span class="paragrafo">
                      Although I initially kept my desire to learn programming a secret, my passion grew with every BYJU'S ad. Finally, I told my father, and together we explored the possibility. After a trial class, my fascination was confirmed. I was delighted, and so were my parents, and since then, I've been with BYJU'S, eager to explore the world of programming. <br>

               <span class="paragrafo">
                    Take a look at the projects I have in the "Projects" section. My passion for programming continues to grow, and I'm excited about what the future holds in this exciting learning journey. <br>
