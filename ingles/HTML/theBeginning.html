    <h2>My story with coding</h2>
   <p>My journey into programming began with an early desire to learn, even at the age of 3, in Salvador. Although I could barely speak, I yearned for a computer course at Microlins. At the age of 8, we moved to São Gonçalo dos Campos for health reasons, but my passion for computers remained latent.</p>

   <p>Now, jumping to the pandemic scenario, I came across the GrassHopper app, which promised to teach programming. Excitedly, I began to learn, but soon realized I wasn't grasping much. Then, BYJU'S Future School appeared on my radar through incessant advertisements. This was the turning point (note: it was the end of 2021).</p>
   
   <p>Although I initially kept my desire to learn programming a secret, my passion grew with every BYJU'S advertisement. Finally, I confided in my father, and together we researched and explored the possibility. After a trial lesson, my fascination was confirmed. I was enchanted, and so were my parents, and since then, I've been at BYJU'S, eager to explore the world of programming.</p>
   
   <p>Take a look at the projects I have in the "Projects" section. My passion for programming only continues to grow, and I'm excited about what the future holds in this thrilling learning journey.</p>
