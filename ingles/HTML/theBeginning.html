    <h2>My story with coding</h2>

    <div class="conteudo">
        <div class="paragrafo">
            <span class="paragrafo">My programming journey kicked off way back when I was just 3 years old in good old Salvador. Even with limited speech skills, I already had a serious interest in computers and a strong desire to take a computer course at Microlins. At the age of 8, the family made a move to São Gonçalo dos Campos (for health reasons), but my passion for technology and computing kept growing like a relentless flame.</span><br>

            <span class="paragrafo">Fast forward to the present, amidst the global pandemic, I stumbled upon the GrassHopper app, promising to open the doors to the programming world. I jumped into it with enthusiasm, but soon faced a lot of confusion. It was at that moment, with plenty of doubts swirling in my head, that BYJU'S Future School kept popping up in ads with tempting promises, marking the beginning of a new phase in my learning journey (note: this happened in late 2021).</span><br>
            <span class="paragrafo">Despite my eagerness to dive into the programming world, initially, I chose to keep this passion a secret. But, no way around it, my love for it only grew with every irresistible BYJU'S ad. Eventually, I made the brave decision to share my dreams with my dad, and together, we embarked on this exciting journey to explore the possibility of me joining BYJU'S. After a trial class, my fascination grew, and so did my determination. I was completely hooked, and my parents, equally excited, supported my decision. Since then, I've been at BYJU'S, ready and determined to explore the vast universe of programming!</span><br>
            <span class="paragrafo">I invite you to explore my achievements and projects in the "Projects" section. My passion for programming knows no bounds and grows every day. I look forward to what the future holds in this exciting learning journey. Each new day is a thrilling opportunity to gain new knowledge and expand my understanding in this fascinating world of programming.</span><br>
